/*

Game Design: A turn based shooting game in 4 dimensions, inspired by Battleship.

In the setup phase, you assign a position to your ship in 4 dimensions within a
3x3x3x3 grid. A computer controlled player does the same thing.

On your turn, you can take 1 of 3 actions:
	1. Move your ship in any direction (perhaps the ship continues to move until
	   the direction is changed)
	2. Query a slice of the grid. (maybe different costs for 1, 2, or 3 full 
	   dimensions?)
		- If different costs, maybe you can choose between: 
			2x 1d slice
			1x 2d slice
			1x 3d slice which takes 2 turns. (is this shown before activating? Would be
			quite interesting if it wasn't, to be honest.)
	3. Launch an attack on a single grid space. If the attack hits, you win.

You go back and forth like this with the computer, and each attack/slice is
seen by the other player. The only information which is not shown to both 
players is the position of the ships.
